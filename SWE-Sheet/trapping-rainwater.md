**Question**: "trapping-rainwater/: Problem Statement: Given an array of non-negative integers representation elevation of ground. Your task is to find the water that can be trapped after rain."

**Approach 1: Brute Force**

The brute force approach involves iterating through each element in the array and calculating the amount of water that can be trapped above it. The maximum amount of water that can be trapped is the minimum of the heights of the two bars to the left and right of it.
```c++
int trap(vector<int>& height) {
  int n = height.size();
  int totalWater = 0;

  for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
    int leftMax = 0, rightMax = 0;

    // Find the maximum height of bars to the left of 'i'
    for (int j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
      leftMax = max(leftMax, height[j]);
    }

    // Find the maximum height of bars to the right of 'i'
    for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
      rightMax = max(rightMax, height[j]);
    }

    // Calculate the amount of water that can be trapped above the 'i'th bar
    int water = min(leftMax, rightMax) - height[i];

    if (water > 0) {
      totalWater += water;
    }
  }

  return totalWater;
}
```
**Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Approach 1:**
Time Complexity: O(N^2). The time complexity is dominated by the nested loops that iterate over all pairs of elements in the array.
Space Complexity: O(1). The space complexity is constant since no additional data structures are used.

**Approach 2: Optimized Approaches using Maps, Multisets, Binary Search, Two Pointers**

* **Maps:** One can use a map to store the maximum height of the bars seen so far on the left and right sides. This allows us to find the amount of water that can be trapped at each index in constant time.

```c++
int trap(vector<int>& height) {
  int n = height.size();
  int totalWater = 0;

  // Store the maximum height of bars seen so far on the left and right sides
  map<int, int> leftMax, rightMax;

  // Iterate over the array from left to right
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // Calculate the amount of water that can be trapped above the 'i'th bar
    int water = min(leftMax[i - 1], rightMax[i + 1]) - height[i];

    if (water > 0) {
      totalWater += water;
    }

    // Update the maximum height of bars seen so far on the left and right sides
    leftMax[i] = max(leftMax[i - 1], height[i]);
    rightMax[i] = max(rightMax[i + 1], height[i]);
  }

  return totalWater;
}
```
**Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Approach 2 using Maps:**
Time Complexity: O(N). The time complexity is dominated by the single pass over the array.
Space Complexity: O(N). The space complexity is used to store the maximum height of the bars seen so far on the left and right sides.

* **Multisets:** We can use a multiset to store the heights of the bars and get the maximum and minimum heights in O(logN) time.

```c++
int trap(vector<int>& height) {
  int n = height.size();
  int totalWater = 0;

  // Initialize a multiset to store the heights of bars
  multiset<int> heights;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // Insert the height of the 'i'th bar into the multiset
    heights.insert(height[i]);
  }

  while (!heights.empty()) {
    // Find the maximum and minimum heights in the multiset
    int maxHeight = *heights.rbegin();
    int minHeight = *heights.begin();

    // Remove the maximum and minimum heights from the multiset
    heights.erase(heights.find(maxHeight));
    heights.erase(heights.find(minHeight));

    // Calculate the amount of water that can be trapped between the maximum and minimum heights
    int water = (maxHeight - minHeight) * (n - 2);

    // Update the total water trapped
    totalWater += water;

    // Decrement the number of bars by two
    n -= 2;
  }

  return totalWater;
}
```
**Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Approach 2 using Multisets:**
Time Complexity: O(NlogN). The time complexity is dominated by the insertions and deletions from the multiset, which take O(logN) time each.
Space Complexity: O(N). The space complexity is used to store the heights of the bars in the multiset.

* **Binary Search:** We can use binary search to find the maximum height of the bars on the left and right sides of each index in O(logN) time.

```c++
int trap(vector<int>& height) {
  int n = height.size();
  int totalWater = 0;

  // Initialize the maximum height of bars seen so far on the left and right sides
  int leftMax = 0, rightMax = 0;

  // Iterate over the array from left to right
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // Find the maximum height of bars to the left of 'i' using binary search
    int left = 0, right = i - 1;
    int leftMaxIndex = -1;

    while (left <= right) {
      int mid = (left + right) / 2;

      if (height[mid] > height[leftMaxIndex]) {
        leftMaxIndex = mid;
      }

      if (height[mid] < height[leftMax]) {
        right = mid - 1;
      } else {
        left = mid + 1;
      }
    }

    leftMax = height[leftMaxIndex];

    // Find the maximum height of bars to the right of 'i' using binary search
    left = i + 1, right = n - 1;
    int rightMaxIndex = -1;

    while (left <= right) {
      int mid = (left + right) / 2;

      if (height[mid] > height[rightMaxIndex]) {
        rightMaxIndex = mid;
      }

      if (height[mid] < height[rightMax]) {
        left = mid + 1;
      } else {
        right = mid - 1;
      }
    }

    rightMax = height[rightMaxIndex];

    // Calculate the amount of water that can be trapped above the 'i'th bar
    int water = min(leftMax, rightMax) - height[i];

    if (water > 0) {
      totalWater += water;
    }
  }

  return totalWater;
}
```
**Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Approach 2 using Binary Search:**
Time Complexity: O(NlogN). The time complexity is dominated by the binary searches to find the maximum height of the bars on the left and right sides of each index.
Space Complexity: O(1). The space complexity is constant since no additional data structures are used.

* **Two Pointers:** We can use two pointers, one starting from the left and one starting from the right, and move them towards each other until they meet. At each step, we calculate the amount of water that can be trapped between the two pointers and update the total water trapped.

```c++
int trap(vector<int>& height) {
  int n = height.size();
  int totalWater = 0;

  // Initialize the left and right pointers
  int left = 0, right = n - 1;

  while (left < right) {
    // Calculate the amount of water that can be trapped between the two pointers
    int water = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left - 1);

    // Update the total water trapped
    totalWater += water;

    // Move the left pointer to the right if it is smaller than the right pointer
    if (height[left] < height[right]) {
      left++;
    } else {
      right--;
    }
  }

  return totalWater;
}
```

Time Complexity: O(N). The time complexity is dominated by the single pass over the array.
Space Complexity: O(1). The space complexity is constant since no additional data structures are used.

**Approach 3: Greedy Algorithms**

**Approach 3a: Maximum Height from Left**

The**Question:** trapping-rainwater/: Problem Statement: Given an array of non-negative integers representation elevation of ground. Your task is to find the water that can be trapped after rain.

**Approach 1: Brute-Force Approach**

**Explanation:**
Traverse the input array and consider each element as a potential boundary of a water-filled area. For each element, determine the maximum height of the boundary on its left and right sides. The difference between the element's value and the minimum of these two boundary heights gives the amount of water that can be trapped at that location. Sum up the water trapped at all possible locations to obtain the total amount of trapped water.

**Approach 1 Code:**
```cpp
int trap(vector<int>& height) {
    int n = height.size();
    int left_max[n], right_max[n];

    // Calculate maximum height to the left of each element
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        left_max[i] = max(left_max[i - 1], height[i - 1]);
    }

    // Calculate maximum height to the right of each element
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        right_max[i] = max(right_max[i + 1], height[i + 1]);
    }

    int total_water = 0;
    // Calculate water trapped at each position
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int water_at_position = min(left_max[i], right_max[i]) - height[i];
        total_water += water_at_position;
    }

    return total_water;
}
```

**Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Approach 1:**
* **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.
* **Space Complexity:** O(n), for storing the left and right maximum height arrays.

**Approach 2: Two-Pointer Approach**

**Explanation:**
Maintain two pointers, one at the left end and one at the right end of the array. While the pointers have not crossed each other:
* If the height at the left pointer is less than or equal to the height at the right pointer, move the left pointer one step to the right. The water trapped at the left pointer can be calculated as the minimum of the maximum height seen so far on the left and right sides minus the current height at the left pointer.
* Otherwise, move the right pointer one step to the left.

**Approach 2 Code:**
```cpp
int trap(vector<int>& height) {
    int left = 0, right = height.size() - 1, max_left = 0, max_right = 0, total_water = 0;

    while (left < right) {
        if (height[left] <= height[right]) {
            max_left = max(max_left, height[left]);
            total_water += max_left - height[left];
            left++;
        }
        else {
            max_right = max(max_right, height[right]);
            total_water += max_right - height[right];
            right--;
        }
    }

    return total_water;
}
```

**Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Approach 2:**
* **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.
* **Space Complexity:** O(1), as constant memory is used, regardless of the size of the input.

**Approach 3: Dynamic Programming**

**Explanation:**
Maintain two arrays, one to store maximum heights from left to right, and another to store maximum heights from right to left. For each element at index i, the amount of water trapped is the minimum of the maximum height seen so far to the left and the maximum height seen so far to the right minus the current height at index i.

**Approach 3 Code:**
```cpp
int trap(vector<int>& height) {
    int n = height.size();
    int left_max[n], right_max[n], total_water = 0;

    // Calculate maximum height from left to right
    left_max[0] = height[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        left_max[i] = max(left_max[i - 1], height[i]);
    }

    // Calculate maximum height from right to left
    right_max[n - 1] = height[n - 1];
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        right_max[i] = max(right_max[i + 1], height[i]);
    }

    // Calculate water trapped at each position
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        total_water += min(left_max[i], right_max[i]) - height[i];
    }

    return total_water;
}
```

**Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Approach 3:**
* **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.
* **Space Complexity:** O(n), for storing the left and right maximum height arrays.
