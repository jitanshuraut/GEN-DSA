## Question:
Given the head of a linked list that may contain a cycle, return the starting point of that cycle. If there is no cycle in the linked list, return null.

## Approach 1: Brute Force

**Explanation:**
Iterate through the linked list and store all the nodes in a set. If a node is already in the set, then we have found the starting point of the cycle.

**C++ Code:**
```cpp
ListNode* detectCycle(ListNode* head) {
  unordered_set<ListNode*> visited;
  ListNode* curr = head;
  while (curr) {
    if (visited.count(curr)) {
      return curr;
    }
    visited.insert(curr);
    curr = curr->next;
  }
  return nullptr;
}
```

**Time and Space Complexity Analysis:**
* Time Complexity: O(n)
* Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.

## Approach 2: Optimized Using Two Pointers - Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm

**Explanation:**
Use two pointers, slow and fast, to iterate through the linked list. If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up with the slow pointer. When they meet, set the slow pointer to the head and continue iterating. The point where the slow and fast pointers meet again is the starting point of the cycle.

**C++ Code:**

```cpp
ListNode* detectCycle(ListNode* head) {
  if (!head || !head->next) return nullptr;
  ListNode* slow = head;
  ListNode* fast = head;

  while (fast && fast->next) {
    slow = slow->next;
    fast = fast->next->next;
    if (slow == fast) break;
  }

  if (slow != fast) return nullptr;

  slow = head;
  while (slow != fast) {
    slow = slow->next;
    fast = fast->next;
  }

  return slow;
}
```

**Time and Space Complexity Analysis:**
* Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
* Space Complexity: O(1).

## Approach 3: Recursive

**Explanation:**
Recursively traverse the linked list, keeping track of the nodes visited in a set. If a node is already in the set, then we have found the starting point of the cycle.

**C++ Code:**

```cpp
unordered_set<ListNode*> visited;

ListNode* detectCycle(ListNode* head) {
  if (!head) return nullptr;

  if (visited.count(head)) {
    return head;
  }

  visited.insert(head);
  return detectCycle(head->next);
}
```

**Time and Space Complexity Analysis:**
* Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
* Space Complexity: O(n), for the stack space used by the recursive function calls.

## Approach 4: Backtracking

**Explanation:**
Starting from the head, traverse the linked list and mark each node with a unique identifier. If a node is already marked, then we have found the starting point of the cycle.

**C++ Code:**

```cpp
int id = 0;
unordered_map<ListNode*, int> node_ids;

ListNode* detectCycle(ListNode* head) {
  ListNode* curr = head;
  while (curr) {
    if (node_ids.count(curr)) {
      return curr;
    }
    node_ids[curr] = id++;
    curr = curr->next;
  }
  return nullptr;
}
```

**Time and Space Complexity Analysis:**
* Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
* Space Complexity: O(n), for the map used to store the node identifiers.**Question**: Given the head of a linked list that may contain a cycle, return the starting point of that cycle. If there is no cycle in the linked list return null.

**Approach 1: Brute Force**

**Explanation**: The brute force approach involves iterating through the linked list until we reach the end or find a duplicate node. We can use a set to keep track of nodes we've seen. If we encounter a node that is already in the set, that node is the starting point of the cycle.

**Approach 1 Code**:
```cpp
ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
  unordered_set<ListNode*> seen;
  ListNode *curr = head;
  while (curr) {
    if (seen.find(curr) != seen.end()) {
      return curr;
    }
    seen.insert(curr);
    curr = curr->next;
  }
  return nullptr;
}
```

**Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Approach 1**:
* Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list.
* Space Complexity: O(N), as we are using a set to keep track of nodes we've seen.

**Approach 2: Two Pointers (Floyd's Tortoise and Hare Algorithm)**

**Explanation**: 
This is a classic algorithm for detecting a cycle in a linked list. Slow and fast pointer will move in the linked list and slow pointer will move one step at a time and fast pointer will move two steps at a time. If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer. The point where they meet is the starting point.

**Approach 2 Code**:
```cpp
ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
  if (!head || !head->next) {
    return nullptr;
  }
  ListNode *slow = head;
  ListNode *fast = head->next;
  while (slow != fast) {
    if (!fast || !fast->next) {
      return nullptr;
    }
    slow = slow->next;
    fast = fast->next->next;
  }
  fast = head;
  while (slow != fast) {
    slow = slow->next;
    fast = fast->next;
  }
  return slow;
}
```

**Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Approach 2**:
* Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list.
* Space Complexity: O(1), as we are using constant space for the two pointers.

**Other Approaches**:
- Mathematical Techniques
- Sweep line Techniques
- Graph Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Trie Data structure

These approaches are not commonly used for this problem, and they may not be as efficient or straightforward as the brute force or two pointers approach.
