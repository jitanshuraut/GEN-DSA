**Question**: "find-k-th-permutation-sequence/: Problem Statement: Given N and K, where N is the sequence of numbers from 1 to N([1,2,3..... N]) find the Kth permutation sequence."

**Approach 1: Brute Force**

**Explanation:**
This is the most straightforward approach, which involves generating all the possible permutations of the numbers from 1 to N and then selecting the Kth one. However, this approach has a very high time complexity of O(N!).

**Approach 1 Code:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

vector<int> generate_permutations(int n) {
  vector<int> perm;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    perm.push_back(i);
  }
  return perm;
}

int main() {
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  vector<int> perm = generate_permutations(n);
  cout << perm[k - 1] << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

**Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Approach 1:**
* Time complexity: O(N!)
* Space complexity: O(N)

**Approach 2: Optimized Approach using Multisets**

**Explanation:**
This approach uses a multiset to store the remaining numbers that can be used in the permutation. It then iterates through the numbers in the multiset and computes the number of permutations that can be formed by placing that number at the current position. It subtracts this count from K to get the remaining count of permutations that need to be generated. It repeats this process until K reaches 0, at which point it prints the number that is currently being considered as the next element in the permutation.

**Approach 2 Code:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <set>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n, k;
  cin >> n >> k;
  multiset<int> remaining;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    remaining.insert(i);
  }
  string perm;
  while (!remaining.empty()) {
    int count = 1;
    for (auto it = remaining.begin(); it != remaining.end(); it++) {
      if (count < k) {
        count *= remaining.count(*it);
      } else {
        perm += to_string(*it);
        remaining.erase(it);
        break;
      }
    }
    k -= count;
  }
  cout << perm << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

**Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Approach 2:**
* Time complexity: O(N * log N)
* Space complexity: O(N)**Question**: Find the Kth Permutation Sequence

**Problem Statement**: Given N and K, where N is the sequence of numbers from 1 to N([1,2,3..... N]) find the Kth permutation sequence.

**Approach 1: Brute Force**

**Explanation**: This approach involves generating all possible permutations of the numbers from 1 to N and then selecting the Kth permutation. This is a straightforward approach, but it can be inefficient for large values of N.

**Approach 1 Code**:
```cpp
vector<int> getPermutation(int n, int k) {
  vector<int> nums(n);
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    nums[i] = i + 1;
  }
  k--;
  while (k > 0) {
    int j = n - 2;
    while (j >= 0 && nums[j] >= nums[j + 1]) {
      j--;
    }
    if (j >= 0) {
      int l = n - 1;
      while (l >= 0 && nums[l] <= nums[j]) {
        l--;
      }
      swap(nums[j], nums[l]);
    }
    reverse(nums.begin() + j + 1, nums.end());
    k--;
  }
  return nums;
}
```

**Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Approach 1:**

* Time Complexity: O(N! * N), where N is the length of the permutation.
* Space Complexity: O(N)

**Approach 2: Mathematical Techniques**

**Explanation**: This approach uses mathematical techniques to directly calculate the Kth permutation. The idea is to use the fact that the Kth permutation can be represented as a base-N number, where each digit represents the position of the corresponding number in the permutation.

**Approach 2 Code**:
```cpp
vector<int> getPermutation(int n, int k) {
  vector<int> perm(n);
  vector<int> factorial(n + 1);
  factorial[0] = 1;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    factorial[i] = factorial[i - 1] * i;
  }
  k--;
  for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    int index = k / factorial[i];
    perm[i] = index + 1;
    vector<int> remaining(n - i - 1);
    for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
      remaining[j] = j + 1;
    }
    remaining.erase(remaining.begin() + index);
    for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
      perm[i + j + 1] = remaining[j];
    }
    k %= factorial[i];
  }
  return perm;
}
```

**Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Approach 2:**

* Time Complexity: O(N^2), where N is the length of the permutation.
* Space Complexity: O(N)

**Approach 3: Heap's Algorithm**

**Explanation**: Heap's algorithm is a recursive algorithm that generates all the permutations of a given set of numbers. It works by repeatedly selecting the first element of the set and then recursively generating all the permutations of the remaining elements.

**Approach 3 Code**:
```cpp
vector<int> getPermutation(int n, int k) {
  vector<int> perm(n);
  vector<bool> used(n + 1, false);
  heapPermutation(n, k, perm, used, 0);
  return perm;
}

void heapPermutation(int n, int k, vector<int> &perm, vector<bool> &used, int i) {
  if (i == n) {
    return;
  }
  for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
    if (!used[j]) {
      used[j] = true;
      perm[i] = j;
      heapPermutation(n, k, perm, used, i + 1);
      if (--k == 0) {
        return;
      }
      used[j] = false;
    }
  }
}
```
