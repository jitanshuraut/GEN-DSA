**Question**: Count Maximum Consecutive Ones in the Array
**Problem Statement**: Given an array that contains only 1 and 0 return the count of maximum consecutive ones in the array.

**Approach 1: Brute Force**
- Iterate through the array and maintain a count of consecutive ones.
- Reset the count to 0 whenever a 0 is encountered.
- Return the maximum count encountered during the iteration.

**Approach 1 Code**:
```cpp
int countMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {
  int maxCount = 0, currentCount = 0;
  for (int num : nums) {
    if (num) {
      currentCount++;
    } else {
      maxCount = max(maxCount, currentCount);
      currentCount = 0;
    }
  }
  return max(maxCount, currentCount);
}
```
**Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Approach 1**:
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as no additional data structure is used.

**Approach 2: Optimized Approach using Two Pointers**
- Initialize two pointers, 'left' and 'right', both pointing to the beginning of the array.
- Iterate through the array while 'right' pointer moves forward.
- If the element pointed to by 'right' is 0, update the maximum count and move 'left' to the next 1.
- If the element pointed to by 'right' is 1, continue moving 'right' forward.
- Return the maximum count encountered during the iteration.

**Approach 2 Code**:
```cpp
int countMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {
  int left = 0, maxCount = 0;
  for (int right = 0; right < nums.size(); right++) {
    if (nums[right] == 0) {
      maxCount = max(maxCount, right - left);
      left = right + 1;
    }
  }
  return max(maxCount, nums.size() - left);
}
```
**Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Approach 2**:
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as no additional data structure is used.

**Approach 3: Recursive Approach**
- Define a recursive function `maxConsecutiveOnes(n, count)` that takes the current element index 'n' and the current count of consecutive ones 'count'.
- If 'n' is less than the length of the array, check if the element at index 'n' is 1.
    - If it is 1, increment 'count' and call the function recursively with 'n + 1' and 'count + 1'.
    - If it is 0, call the function recursively with 'n + 1' and 0.
- If 'n' is equal to the length of the array, return 'count'.
- Return the maximum count encountered during the recursion.

**Approach 3 Code**:
```cpp
int countMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {
  return maxConsecutiveOnes(0, 0, nums);
}

int maxConsecutiveOnes(int n, int count, vector<int>& nums) {
  if (n < nums.size()) {
    if (nums[n] == 1) {
      return maxConsecutiveOnes(n + 1, count + 1, nums);
    } else {
      return maxConsecutiveOnes(n + 1, 0, nums);
    }
  }
  return count;
}
```
**Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Approach 3**:
- Time Complexity: O(2^n), where n is the length of the array.
- Space Complexity: O(n), as the recursion stack can grow up to n levels.**Question**: Count Maximum Consecutive Ones in Array.
**Problem Statement**: Given an array that contains only 1 and 0 return the count of maximum consecutive ones in the array.

**Approach 1: Brute Force**

**Explanation**: In the brute force approach, we will iterate through the array and count the number of consecutive ones and keep updating the maximum count.

**Approach 1 Code:**
```cpp
int countMaxConsecutiveOnes(int arr[], int n) {
    int max_count = 0;
    int curr_count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == 1) {
            curr_count++;
        } else {
            max_count = max(max_count, curr_count);
            curr_count = 0;
        }
    }
    max_count = max(max_count, curr_count);
    return max_count;
}
```

**Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Approach 1**:
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the array.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as we are not using any extra space.

**Approach 2: Sliding Window Technique**

**Explanation**: In the sliding window technique, we use two pointers, 'start' and 'end', to maintain a window of consecutive ones. We move the 'end' pointer until we find a 0 and then update the 'max_count' with the length of the current window. We then move the 'start' pointer to the next 1.

**Approach 2 Code:**
```cpp
int countMaxConsecutiveOnes(int arr[], int n) {
    int max_count = 0;
    int start = 0;
    for (int end = 0; end < n; end++) {
        if (arr[end] == 0) {
            max_count = max(max_count, end - start);
            start = end + 1;
        }
    }
    max_count = max(max_count, n - start);
    return max_count;
}
```

**Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Approach 2**:
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the array.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as we are not using any extra space.

**Approach 3: Mathematical Techniques**

**Explanation**: This approach uses mathematical techniques to keep track of the current count of consecutive ones and the maximum count so far.

**Approach 3 Code:**
```cpp
int countMaxConsecutiveOnes(int arr[], int n) {
    int max_count = 0;
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == 1) {
            count++;
        } else {
            max_count = max(max_count, count);
            count = 0;
        }
    }
    max_count = max(max_count, count);
    return max_count;
}
```

**Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Approach 3**:
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the array.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as we are not using any extra space.

**Approach 4: Sweep Line Techniques**

**Explanation**: In the sweep line technique, we create a sweep line that starts at the first element of the array and moves from left to right. At each step, we check if the current element is 1 and, if so, we update the maximum count.

**Approach 4 Code:**
```cpp
int countMaxConsecutiveOnes(int arr[], int n) {
    int max_count = 0;
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == 1) {
            count++;
        } else {
            count = 0;
        }
        max_count = max(max_count, count);
    }
    return max_count;
}
```

**Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Approach 4**:
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the array.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as we are not using any extra space.

**Approach 5: Graph Algorithms**

This problem does not have a direct application for graph algorithms.

**Approach 6: Dynamic Programming**

**Explanation**: We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We define a dp array such that dp[i] stores the maximum count of consecutive ones ending at index i. We can compute dp[i] as follows:
- If arr[i] == 1, then dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1.
- If arr[i] == 0, then dp[i] = 0.

**Approach 6 Code:**
```cpp
int countMaxConsecutiveOnes(int arr[], int n) {
    int dp[n];
    dp[0] = arr[0];
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == 1) {
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1;
        } else {
            dp[i] = 0;
        }
    }
    int max_count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        max_count = max(max_count, dp[i]);
    }
    return max_count;
}
```

**Time and Space Complexity Analysis for Approach 6**:
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the size of the array.
- Space Complexity: O(n), as we are using an array of size n.

**Approach 7: Trie Data Structure**

This problem does not have a direct application for trie data structure.
